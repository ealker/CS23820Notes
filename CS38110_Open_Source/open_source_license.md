# Intellectual Property 

_Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce._ from [WIPO](https://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/)

- Copyright
- Patents 
- Trademarks 


- Copyleft: _"Copyleft, distinguished from copyright, is the practice of offering people the right to freely distribute copies and modified versions of a work with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in derivative works created later."_

# Licenses 
There are [many open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) that developers and organisations [can use](https://choosealicense.com/) when they release their software. The licenses that are included in Aberystwyth's CS38110 module are MIT, GNU GPL, BSD and Apache. 

There are **two main types** of licenses used in open source projects, permissive licenses and copyleft licenses.

## Permissive Licenses: Apache, BSD & MIT

Based off of the [lecture](http://users.aber.ac.uk/mjh25/cs381/reveal/L9-Permissive_licenses.html) by [Malcolm Hutchison](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/staff-profiles/listing/profile/mjh25/).

### Apache 

### BSD: Berkeley Software Distribution

### MIT: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Projects that use MIT: X.Org, JQuery, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Lua, Jenkins, MS VS Code 


## Copyleft Licenses: GNU GPL

> _""Copyleft licenses" require licensee to license specific developments (if they are not restricted to internal use) to anyone under the original license. This ensures that everyone who profits from open-source software will offer their developments to the developer community."_ from the [Institue for Legal Questions on Free and Open Source Software](https://www.ifross.org/en/what-types-licenses-are-there-open-source-software-and-how-do-they-differ).

### GNU GPL 

The GNU General Public License was first written by Richard Stallman (RMS) and published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1989. 

GPL violations - modifying and redistruibtion of code. 

"Any code which links to GPL’ed code becomes GPL’ed"

#### Differences between GPLv2 and GPLv3? 

GPLv3 was first published on June 29th 2007. 

#### GNU LGPL

The GNU Lesser General Public License allows developers to use software components released under the license in their proprietary projects. Such projects are not then subject to the copyleft clauses that the GPL imposes. However, any modification to a piece of LGPL software has to be released under the same LGPL license.

# Relevant Questions from Past Papers 

### 2016-17

- Question 1: A number of different licensing options have been discussed in the course.
  - a) Provide a detailed discussion of the differences between the Apache License, the GNU GPL and the GNU LGPL. Provide some indications as to why a developer may want to choose one license over another when releasing their own code. [40 marks]
  - b) Dual licensing with GPL, such as the MySQL licensing is an option. Discuss how this would affect the use of a MySQL database for use in software that you wanted to sell as a commercial product. [10 marks]
- Question 3: This question is on the subject of software patents, and it is based upon the guest lecture given by Richard M Stallman on 31st October 2011. The talk was essentially the same as given on 8 October 2009 at Victoria University of Wellington, the transcript of which you have studied.
  - a) Describe the fundamental differences between the concepts of Copyright and Patent. [5 marks]
  - b) Using an analogy, possibly from music, illustrate how software patents can be detrimental to the software industry because of the combinatorial nature of software design. [20 marks]
  - c) The patent system was apparently initially devised to protect the rights of ‘the starving genius’, and this argument is often repeated to defend the system itself. Discuss how the patent system is used by large corporations and how this negates the argument and therefore weakens the purpose of having a patent system for software at all. [25 marks]
  
 ### 2017-18 
 
 - Question 1: This question concerns licenses.
  - a) Describe the terms of academic permissive licences (MIT, BSD and Apache) [15 marks]
  - b) Describe the terms of the GNU General Public License. [15 marks]
  - c) Provide a detailed discussion of the differences between academic licenses (MIT, BSD and Apache), the GNU General Public License and typical proprietary licenses. Provide some indications as to why a developer may want to choose one license over another when releasing his own code. [20 marks]

 ### 2018-19
 
- Question 1: This question concerns licenses and intellectual property.
  - a) Open source software has been used in software as a service (e.g. Wordpress hosting) and also in embedded devices (e.g. set-top boxes). How can users be prevented from exercising their freedom fully when code licensed under version 2 of the GNU Public Licence (GPL) is used in these instances, and how does version 3 of the GPL attempt to address these problems? [20 marks]
  - b) This question concerns patents
    - (i) What problems do software patents cause open source software projects? [5 marks]
    - (ii) How do open source licences address the issue of patents? [15 marks]
  - c) The GPL has not [at time of writing] been tested in a UK court, however it has been tested in other European Union (EU) nations, e.g. Germany. Outline an example of the GPL being tested in a German court and describe the outcome. [10 marks]
