# The Cathedral and the Bazaar Notes 

## Four Freedoms

Two types of free - libre (as in free speech) and gratis (as in free beer). A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.


## The Cathederal and the Bazaar 

## [Homesteading the Noosphere](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/) 

Property and ownership with OSS.

Lockean theory of ownership. 

### Past Papers

#### 2014-15

- Question 2: This question concerns economics of open source development.
  - a) Describe the differences between an exchange economy and a gift economy. Discuss why development of free and open source software often resembles a gift economy instead of an exchange economy. [10 marks]

#### 2016-17 

- Question 2: “The owner of an open source software project is the person who has the exclusive right, recognised by the community at large, to distribute modified versions.” Homesteading the Noosphere — Eric S. Raymond (1999)
  - a) Name and describe in detail the three ways in which the ownership of a software project can be acquired. [15 marks]
  - b) Describe how the above might relate to the Lockean theory of property, and the Anglo-American common-law theory of land tenure. [15 marks]
  - c) Provide an in-depth discussion of how Open Source Development might be viewed as a Gift Culture. Compare to the possibility of the craftsmanship
model. [20 marks]

#### 2018-19 

- Question 2: 
  - c) There are three ways that you can become the owner of an Open Source project. What are these (briefly explain)? [9]
  - d) Explain the concept of homesteading, as used in the chapter Homesteading the Noosphere. What areas might there still be in the open source noosphere that are still to be claimed? (You may recall a discussion we had about this in lectures, where some good ideas were suggested.) [11]

## [The Magic Cauldron](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/magic-cauldron/)

Economics of OSS. Answers the question of "How do I make money with open source software?".

Manufacturing Delusion 

 - Only 5% of industry salaries are sale-value driven. 
 - Software is a service industry. 
 
 Tradegy of the Commons 
 
 - Over consumption, under investment.
 - Arises when an individual has an incentive to consume to the detriment of others. 
 - Personal gain over common good. 
 
 Indirect Sales 
 
 - Loss Leader 
   - Open source the software in order to buy proprietary software. Open source client but closed source server software, for example.
 - Widget Frosting
   - For hardware manufacturers. 
 - Recipe/Restaurant
   - For services like RHEL.
 - Accessorising
   - Open source the software but sell accessories to that - high end documentation or low end stuff like T-Shirts.
 - Free Future, Sell Present
   - Sell the current version, open source and make the previous version free.
 - Free Software, Sell Brand 
   - Arduino release diagrams, you can buy cheap boards because of this. Most people buy the premium boards from Arduino.

### Past Papers 

#### 2014-15 

- Question 2: This question concerns economics of open source development. 
  - a) Describe the differences between an exchange economy and a gift economy. Discuss why development of free and open source software often resembles a gift economy instead of an exchange economy. [10 marks]
  - b) Briefly discuss the difficulties in recouping the cost of open source software development using a direct sales model. [5 marks]
  - c) Describe five alternative sales strategies for recouping the cost of open source software development. [15 marks]
  - d) In some software markets (for example web servers) open source products have come to dominate, yet in others (for example desktop operating systems) they still only hold a minority share of the market. Discuss, with reference to relevant examples, what barriers have prevented open source products from gaining a foothold in some markets and the factors that have allowed it to flourish in others. You are expected to give two or three barriers and another two or three factors that have allowed open source to flourish. [20 marks]

#### 2015-16

- Question 1: 
  - b) Eric S. Raymond describes a number of ways of monetising Open Source software. He cites two Use-value funding models: Cost-Sharing and Risk-Spreading. Provide a detailed description, with case studies, of each of these funding models. [10 marks]
  - c) Direct sale-value poses a problem with Open Source software. There are indirect sale-value models though. Describe and explain five different examples of indirect sale models. [25 marks]

#### 2017-18 

- Question 2: 
  - b) (ii) Although the direct selling of open source software poses a problem, there are indirect sale-value models. Give at least three different examples of indirect sale models, briefly explaining how they work.
