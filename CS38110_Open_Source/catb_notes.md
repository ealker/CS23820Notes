Economics of OSS. Answers the question of "How do I make money with open source software?".

Manufacturing Delusion 

 - Only 5% of industry salaries are sale-value driven. 
 - Software is a service industry. 
 
 Tradegy of the Commons 
 
 - Over consumption, under investment.
 - Arises when an individual has an incentive to consume to the detriment of others. 
 - Personal gain over common good. 
 
 Indirect Sales 
 
 - Loss Leader 
  - Open source the software in order to buy proprietary software. Open source client but closed source server software, for example.
 - Widget Frosting
  - For hardware manufacturers. 
 - Recipe/Restaurant
  - For services like RHEL.
 - Accessorising
  - Open source the software but sell accessories to that - high end documentation or low end stuff like T-Shirts.
 - Free Future, Sell Present
  - Sell the current version, open source and make the previous version free.
 - Free Software, Sell Brand 
  - Arduino release diagrams, you can buy cheap boards because of this. Most people buy the premium boards from Arduino.
