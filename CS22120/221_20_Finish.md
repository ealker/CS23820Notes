### To Do 

- Close the issues on GitLab.
- Finish the build.

- Check in with each person once daily. 1 to 1. 
- Work 9 to 6 each day. 

### Questions to think about as a team

Where is our group going work? 

How are we going to make our list of things? 

How are we going to keep track of it over time? 

When should we have group meetings? 

Who will be repsonsible for making sure that the repo is in a good state? 

When do you want to demo? 

On the 7th applied graphics, so not at that time.
