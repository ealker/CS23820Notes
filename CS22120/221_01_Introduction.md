# CS22120 Lecture 1
## Introduction to Software Engineering 

Friday January 26th 2018   
Lecturer: Chris Price   
Notes: Elliot Alker   

"I said "Developing Software Professionals" was at the heart of second year."

### Breakdown 
75% Group Project 

 - Not just how **well** it works, but your use and understanding of software engineering methods.
 - Build the software as if it will be maintained for years. 

25% Exam Based

- Lectures provide context for the project, material for the exam and knowledge of how software is made in the industry. 

- Tutorials provide guidance and support for the project. 

### Teams 

- Teams are made of 7/8 people. 
- First year programming marks rank the whole year. Every 18 people are grouped. One from each group make up a team. 
- Everybody on the team gets the same mark:
    - You can fuck up by not participating and not pulling your weight. 
    - Like football, you get yellow and red cards for fucking up. 
    - Blogs are evidence for your contribution, as is contributions to the central project repository. 

### The Project 

Java implementation of a game called "JoggleCube". 

Like Boggle, although it's different. It's a one player word making game. Instead of a 5 by 5 2D grid, you have a 3 by 3 by 3 cube of letters and have to spell words in limited time. 

Go from letter to letter where faces, edges or corners meet, but can only use a letter on the grid once in one word.

Game needs to generate grids. 

Dictionary of at least 50,000 words - think about lookup times. Searching dictionaries. 

### Emphasis 

- Not enough to just get it working. 
- Need to work as a team. 
- Need to produce maintainable software.
- Cover all aspets of the software lifecycle. 
- Judge it - if someone were to maintain your code, would they hate you? 
- Code should reduce risk. You can't design well if you don't know how key components work. 

**At least a day a week should be spent on doing your group project.** 

## Deadlines 

- By 4th Tutorial (19th Feb) User manual for the designed system.
- By 4th Tutorial (19th Feb) Test specification for the final system.
- By 8th Tutorial (19th March) Design specification for the final system. 

You need to be gradually developing the software. 

Week 30th April - Integration Week 

Each team will take what they have from the first ten weeks of the semester, and make a finished product that matches design spec. 

- By May 4th -  Code will be delivered. 
- By May 9th - Documents to be delivered. 
- By May 8th to 10th - Demo/Testing 

## Standards 

Project standards ensure that software is engineered. 

Look at these standards: QA Document SE.AQ.01-10

### Project Workings 

- Chris Price is the client. 
- Tutor is the PM.
- Project lead is chosen by the group. They will ensure the day to day running of the project. 
- Weekly tutorials: assign tasks to people, catch up with what has previously happened. 
- In between: complete the tasks assigned to you. Blog your effort and how it is spent. Report the blog to the weekly tutorial. 
- If the code isn't in the repo, or if the blog post isn't online, or if you can't show your team the work, you've not done the work. 

## By Next Week 

- Put dates in calendar. [DONE]
- Learn about source control. [DONE] 
- Set up a blog for the project and provide the link to your tutor. [DONE]
- Read the Requirements Spec for the project and note any items that are vague. [DONE]
- Read the project documentation. [DONE]
