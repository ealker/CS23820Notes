- It's not coding, so developers don't think that it's productive. 
- People like to rush through difficult tasks. 

It's all about asking the correct questions: 

- Need to understand the problem domain. 
- To aqquire the experience of building systems. 
- You need to have an understanding of the domain that you're working in (finance, pharam, education, etc.) and software engineering. 
- Need to follow a reigorous, methodical approach.
