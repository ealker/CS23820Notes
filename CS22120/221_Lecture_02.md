# CS22120 Lecture 2 - Source Control 

Friday January 26th 2018 
Lecturer: Chris Price   
Notes: Elliot Alker 

"Joel Spolsky (Stack Overflow) says it is the most important thing a project team can do."

### Why Is Source Control Important? 

- Hard drives break (you need a non-local copy of your work!)
- People delete stuff by mistake.
- People find they need access to old versions of their work.
- People need to keep track of which version is which.
- We sometimes need to know why things changed (or who) People need to share code on a project.
- People need to work on multiple lines of development simultaneously and independently.

A general idea is that multiple people working on a project have access to a single repository that work can be checked into and out of. Sorting this out manually, with a crude revision system is incredibly difficult to implement. This is where an automated service stepped in: 

- Source Code Manager 
- Version Control System 
- Revision Control System 
- Content Tracking System 

For developers, [Git](https://git-scm.com) is a great solution: 

- Modern, distributed content tracking system. 
- Faster and more efficient than other SCM tools (Subversion, CVS, Perforce, etc.). 

#### History 

- Originally built by Linus Torvolds to support the development of Linux after devs stopped using the proprietry "BitKeeper" SCM. 
- 1000s of developers working on Linux all across the world.
- Want them to be able to change files at the same time, but still be able to bring changes together.
- History of the name is [funny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).
