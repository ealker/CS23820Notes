## XP Approach to Planning 

XP takes a "planning games" approach to planning software projects. 

> "The emphasis is on steering the project – which is quite straightforward – rather than on exact prediction of what will be needed and how long it will take – which is quite difficult." from [Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/)

## Stories 

_A story is a promise of a future conversation._

These conversations can be had at any point in time during the project, the purpose is that the conversations provide regular feedback between the team and the customer. 

- Stories don't have a prescribed format - they can be presented in whatever way a team things is useful.
