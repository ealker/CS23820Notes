# Planning 

## Traditional Planning 

Once requirements are gathered, a team will plan the work to be done at the beginning of the project. Planning is expensive in this project management paradigm, so it is done infrequently. Because of its cost, the final plan is often quite extensive, and contains information about edge case that might arise during the project. Typically, project managers will use tools like Gantt charts or resource diagrams, and these tools provide a sense of security for the project managers. The downside, of course, is that the project plan is incredibly brittle - the PM could have produced a plan that is well thought through, but the project might be solving the wrong problem. 

## XP Approach to Planning 

XP takes an approach to planning software projects called "Planning Games". Planning is used to maximise business value. In contrast with traditional planning, XP ensures that planning is inexpensive and because of this, it is done frequently (this is in an effort to flatten the cost of change curve).

> "The emphasis is on steering the project – which is quite straightforward – rather than on exact prediction of what will be needed and how long it will take – which is quite difficult." from [Ron Jeffries](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/)

## Stories 

_A story is a promise of a future conversation._

These conversations can be had at any point in time during the project, the purpose is that the conversations provide regular feedback between the team and the customer. 

- Stories don't have a prescribed format - they can be presented in whatever way a team things is useful. 

## Velocity

_The project velocity (or just velocity) is a measure of how much work is getting done on your project. To measure the project velocity you simply add up the estimates of the user stories that were finished during the iteration. It's just that simple._
