# Extreme Programming 

## What is Extreme Programming?

Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile software development framework - think of it as an implementation of the Agile principles and ideals. XP has a set [lifecyle](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/map/project.html) which teams can use to manage a project. With traditional project planning, there is a cost of change curve that shows that changes cost different amounts depending on when they are made - a change early in the project is cheaper to make than a change that has to be implemented later. A key motivation behind XP is an attempt to flatten the curve - change should be accounted for and if it is, then the cost of making a change should not rise in proportion to when it is made.   

> Extreme Programming stresses customer satisfaction. Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it.
