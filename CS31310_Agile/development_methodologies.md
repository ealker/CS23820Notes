# Development Methodologies 

## Motivation 

Traditional software projects were managed via a model that came to be known as Waterfall. This software development model originated with Royce's paper, _Managing the Development of Large Software Systems_. 

Brook's no silver bullet. Accident and essance - accident is programming langauges. 

Projects late, over budget (Denver airport), catastrophic in some instances (Therac-25)

Problems with ‘traditional’ approaches
• Project success is just luck
• Integration nightmares
• Low sponsor expectations
• Smelly software: it’s brittle, wrong features, missing features, buggy...

Looking for a better way to do things. Start by looking at what hinders the development process - for example requirements.

In September 2006 Ken Schawber gives a [talk at google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyNPeTn8fpo&feature=youtu.be&t=48m50s).

## History of Agile 

A group of influential software developer's got together in Utah in 2001 and published a manifesto for "uncovering better ways of developing softeare by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value..." 

The manifesto has four points: 

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
- Wokring software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan


# Extreme Programming (XP)

> Read _The Art of Agile Software Development_ by Shore and Warden

### What is Extreme Programming?

Detailed by Kent Beck in 1999. “Extreme Programming (XP) is about social change. It is about letting go of habits and patterns that were adaptive in the past, but now get in the way of us doing our best work. It is about giving up the defences that protect us but interfere with our productivity. It may leave us feeling exposed.”
Kent Beck with Cynthia Andres (2005) Extreme Programming Explained 2nd Edition. Addison Wesley, Boston.

Established on earlier C3 program. 

Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile software development framework - think of it as an implementation of the Agile principles and ideals. XP has a set [lifecyle](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/map/project.html) which teams can use to manage a project. With traditional project planning, there is a cost of change curve that shows that changes cost different amounts depending on when they are made - a change early in the project is cheaper to make than a change that has to be implemented later. A key motivation behind XP is an attempt to flatten the curve - change should be accounted for and if it is, then the cost of making a change should not rise in proportion to when it is made.   

> Extreme Programming stresses customer satisfaction. Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future, this process delivers the software you need as you need it.


- Short iterations of 1 - 4 weeks and a total time of 1 - 3 months, versus traditional lifecycle of 3 - 24 months. 

### Values of XP

XP stresses _five_ values: 

- Simplicity: Do what is needed, no more. (maximises value for investment)
- Communication: XP demands communication.
- Feedback: Continual feedback loop with stakeholders. Adapt process to fit the project.
- Courage: Courage to be open about progress. Courage to make changes.
- Respect: Between developers and between developers and stakeholders.


### Motivation behind XP

Cost of change curve - the later in the development lifecycle the more expensive it is to make a change. XP hopes to flatten the curve.  

## XP Practices 

There are twelve XP practices

1. Planning Games
2. Test Driven Development
3. Pair Programming
4. Merciless Refactoring
5. Simple Design 
6. Collective Code Ownership
7. Continuous Integration
8. On-site Customer
9. Small releases
10. Sustainable development
11. Coding Standards 
12. Metaphor for the System 

## Review of XP

- XP started on the C3 Project, with Kent Beck as one of the three developers

# Scrum 

Scrum is focused on process management - it describes a process and some rules for that process. 

Scrum was developed from "the rugby aproach" introduced in a 1986 paper by Takeuchi and Nonaka titled "The New New Product Development Game". 

Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland independently built on this idea until they came together and started to develop the Scrum framework in 1995 when they published a paper at OOPSLA '95. 

The Srcum Master's role is to ensure that the team get the most of the Scrum process.

Plannin

## Three Pillars 

1. Transparency
2. Inspection
3. Adaptation - the process should be fluid; if it's not working, change it. 

## Scrum Teams 

Scrum encourages teams to be self organising. There are various roles in a Scrum team: 

- Scrum Master 
- Product Owner 
- Team 

### How does Scrum work 

3. Daily Scrum - this is held every day of the sprint and is a way for the team to plan the activities of the day ahead. 
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospective

### Scrum Rules 

- No one but the product owner can cancel a Sprint. 
- Daily standups should only last for 15 minutes. 
- A sprint review is typically 3 hours. 


# Kanban / Lean

Kanban is focused on process improvement. 



## Features of Kanban
