University reading lists can be found [here](http://aspire.aber.ac.uk/index.html).

## CS10720

- **Introduction to Algorithms** by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

### CS21120

- **Data structures and algorithms in Java** by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, Michael H. Goldwasser.
  + Covers fundamental data strcutures, ADTs and algorithms. I found this incredibly helpful for understand concepts ready for tutorials (seminars) and the coded examples helped when I needed to complete worksheets. 

- **[Open Data Structures](http://opendatastructures.org/)**
  + Clear examples of data structures and by far the most accessible resource on this topic; there is a version for every major programming language. 


### CS27020

- **Database systems: a practical approach to design, implementation, and management** by Thomas M. Connolly, Carolyn E. Beg.
  + This is a *very* dry read, but helped with my understanding of functional dependencies and the normalisation process.
