### Introduction

There is no single best way of constructing a software system, but there are several methodologies that provide a framework for how to develop them. At present, there is a split between plan based approaches and agile development approaches. As general rule of thumb applies to chosing which method to follow: 

- Does the system being built have a well understood system description and will last greater than five years? Use a plan based software development methodology.
- Does the system beung built have a very abstract system description and will it rapdily change? Use an agile based software development methodology. 

### Components of the Software Development Lifecycle

- Implementation 
- Testing 
- Deployment 
- Maintenance
