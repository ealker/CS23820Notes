### Identification of Problems

Bad decisions are usually ill informed, made under pressure and acted upon quickly. Over time, the effects of these decisions can spiral - think Watergate scandal or the VW emissions scandal. "Crossing the line" often leads to further encroachment, and the line between morally acceptable and morally rephrensible gets blurred. When the unrelenting advancement of technology gets thrown into the mix, it is often difficult to discern the good from the bad. Five "rule of thumb" tests can be applied to decide if a situation/decision/problem/etc. is ethical. 

### 5 Tests 

**Gut Feeling Test**  
Does it feel right? If this comes into question, you need to explore the issue further.  

**Need to Keep It Quiet Test**  
Would users/management/the public be happy if they knew every detail of the issue and your proposed course of action. 

**Could I Tell My Mother Test**  
How would you go about explaining the issue to your mother, who is presumably non-technical? Would she take an issue with what you told her? (Swap mother for a close, older relative.)

**TV Interview Test**    
If you were honest on a TV interview, would the people watching be happy with what you were telling them?

**If It Was Done To Me Test**
For example, if you used the software/system, would you be happy with using it? Would you be happy with agreeing to all the terms of using the software?
