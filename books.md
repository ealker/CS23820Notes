### CS27020

- **Database systems: a practical approach to design, implementation, and management** by Thomas M. Connolly, Carolyn E. Beg.
  + This is a *very* dry read, but helped with my understanding of functional dependencies and the normalisation process.
  
### CS21120

- **Data structures and algorithms in Java** by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, Michael H. Goldwasser.
  + Covers fundamental data strcutures, ADTs and algorithms. I found this incredibly helpful for understand concepts ready for tutorials (seminars) and the coded examples helped when I needed to complete worksheets.
