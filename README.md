# University Notes

In order to avoid distractions during lectures, my laptop stays in my bag and I handwrite my notes. I then review these handwritten notes later in the library or at home and type them up in markdown. This system has taken me a while to refine, and is based off of [this](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu//~rapaport/howtostudy.html#takenotesinclass) guide from the Computer Science department at the University of Buffalo. The guide is well worth the read for any university student. 

Each module has its own folder, and each markdown file is a compelte lecture. Sometimes lectures are spilt into multiple "parts".

For a complete list of the modules I'm taking/have taken, visit my personal [university profile](http://users.aber.ac.uk/ela12/).
