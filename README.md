# University Notes

In order to avoid distractions during lectures, my laptop stays in my bag and I handwrite my notes. I then review these handwritten notes later in the library or at home and type them up in markdown. This system has taken me a while to refine, and is based off of [this](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu//~rapaport/howtostudy.html#takenotesinclass) guide from the Computer Science department at the University of Buffalo. The guide is well worth the read for any university student.
