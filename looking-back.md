# Looking Back (what I wish I knew when starting my Computer Science Degree)

## Actually learning how to use a computer 

Before university I could build a PC, use various operating systems, work in the shell, recite the history of various software projects, etc., but I never really knew how to use a computer _really_ well. 
I could use ls, cd, basic grep commands but anything more complex than a simple RegEx and I would give up. I had a good introduction to using computers during university, 
in a first year module called Introduction To Computer Infrastructure; I had a lot of fun working through the workshops that tested my skills in all things Unix-y and 
it's also where I met my first mentor.

The [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) course by MIT is a well thought out and useful way of getting to know how to really use your tools as a Software Engineer / Computer
Scientist.
