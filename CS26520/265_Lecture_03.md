## Knowledge Based Systems
Choosing a suitable method for knowledge representations is the foundation of the larger goal of building a knowledge based system. This system shold: 

- Accept new tasks in the form of explicitly described goals.
- Achieve competence quickly by being told or learning new knowledge about the environment.
- Adapt to changes by updating relevant knowledge.

Now that the motivation for knowledge representation is clear, we should look to develop a language for knowledge representation.

## Towards a Language for Knowledge Representation

There are two key aspects in developing a language for KR:

 - Semantics: The facts in the world to which sentences in the language refer.
 - Syntax: The intricate legalities of the language. 

 Reasoning in a KBS involves the generation and manipulation of symbols. 

## Knowledge Representation Schemes 

### Declarative Schemes 

#### Logic
Types: 
    - Propositional Logic (Boolean Logic)
    
    - First Order Logic (First Order Predicate Calculus)

Pros:
Cons: 

#### Semantic Networks 

Pros:
Cons:

### Imperative 

#### Procedural Languages 
#### Recipes 

### Mixed 

#### Frames
Pros:
Cons:

#### Production Systems

## Logic Terms 

### Entailment 
### Inference 
### Soundness 
### Completeness 
### Grounding
