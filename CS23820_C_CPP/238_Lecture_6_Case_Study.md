__Monday, October 23rd 2017__ 
 
**Lecture:** Dave Price and Fred Long  
**Notes:** ela12@aber.ac.uk

## Problem Definition 

- Write a program that will read in the results of football matches and create a current "league table" based on the results. 
- **17 teams** in the league. Each teams plays every other team twice, once at home and once away, therefore **each team plays 32 games**. 
- If a team scores more goals than their opponents in a given game they are said to win and are awarded 3 points, with the losing team given 0 points. 
- If neither team score, or both teams score the same number of goals, they are said to draw the game and each team gets 1 point!

## Towards a solution 

- Read a file containing the last league table. 
- Read in a file of new football match results. 
- Produce a table.
